--TemporaryWarp--

TemporaryWarp manifesto

Players are able to teleport to predetermined locations for a set amount of time, before they are teleported back

Players are either teleported back to their prior location, a warp specific location or a default location

The plugin is smart enough to make sure players are warped back to their temporary location if they die within the time limit

The plugin is smart enough to make sure players are returned to where they need to go should they have logged out or server is shut down/crashed before their time is up

If players leave their location for whatever reason, and they still have time left, they can return to the location

Players will only be able to visit one location at a time, as to avoid confusion on the plugin and user side. If players still have time left, they are free to set the clock to zero, and thus the plugin will act accordingly.
